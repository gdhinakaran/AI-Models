# AI Models – Learning & Experiments

This repository contains learning projects, experiments, and prototypes created as part of my AI training journey (including *Build for Andrew*).

The goal of this repo is to:
- Learn by building small, concrete projects
- Experiment with AI concepts hands-on
- Document progress and thinking clearly

## 📁 Structure (will evolve)

Each folder represents a self-contained experiment or mini-project.

Example:
---

## 🧠 What I’m focusing on
- Building simple, working AI-powered tools
- Understanding fundamentals before optimization
- Writing clear explanations of what I learn

---

## 🚧 Status
This repository is actively evolving. Expect rough edges, experiments, and iteration.
